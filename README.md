Overview
This repository demonstrates how to explore the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset using plain SQL. The goal is to practice querying, generate reproducible health insights, and provide a template for other analysts.


Background
The dataset (768 patients, 14 attributes) is a classic benchmark for cardiovascular risk modeling. The target column (num) indicates presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.


Key Insights
Insight
Value
Most common chest‑pain type
cp = 3 (142 patients)
Avg. age by chest‑pain type
Types 0 & 3 ≈ 55 yr; type 1 ≈ 51 yr
Cholesterol (age > 50)
Type 1 = 259 mg/dL (highest), Type 0 = 240 mg/dL (lowest)
Gender & disease
Males show higher incidence than females
High‑risk profile
Male, ≥55 — cp = 3, high blood pressure, high oldpeak
