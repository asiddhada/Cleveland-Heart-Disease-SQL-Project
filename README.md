Overview
This repository demonstrates how to explore the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset using plain SQL. The goal is to practice querying, generate reproducible health insights, and provide a template for other analysts.


Background
The dataset (768 patients, 14 attributes) is a classic benchmark for cardiovascular risk modeling. The target column (num) indicates presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.


Key Insights
